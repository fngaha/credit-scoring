# Credit-G Scoring (CRISP-DM)

This project applies the **CRISP-DM methodology** to build a **credit scoring model** using the `credit-g` dataset (available on [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/d/31)).

---

## Objective

The main goal is to **predict the credit risk** (good or bad credit) of applicants based on socio-economic and financial features.

This project demonstrates:
- The **end-to-end data science process** from understanding to deployment.
- The application of **best practices in machine learning pipelines**.
- The use of **modern tools** for reproducibility and interpretability.
